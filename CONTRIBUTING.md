# Contributing to @nhl-api packages

Thanks so much for considering contributing! The goal of this repository is to be a wrapper around the NHL API, as well as provide some 'missing' pieces of it (team colors, a full list of players, player nicknames, etc.).

Before making a change-- first discuss the change you want to make via the issue tracker, email, twitter, carrier pigeon, etc. If it's a small fix or change, details in the PR template are good enough.

## Bug reports

tl;dr: a good bug report shouldn't leave anyone scratching their head trying to understand the problem. Please fill out the issue template, that's why it's there.

## Feature requests

These are always welcome, but it's always appreciated if you take an extra minute to decide if the change you'd like fits within the scope of the packages / goals of the project. Please fill out the template when requesting a feature so that anyone who comes across it can discuss it.

## Pull requests

As stated above, any PRs for small fixes are welcome without needing to fill out other templates aside from the PR template. 

If you want to make a significant change, please open a feature request first.

**IMPORTANT:** By submitting any code fixes/features, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](./LICENSE).

## Code of Conduct

Hockey is for everyone.
